          <p>We would like to point out if there are other persons responsible for the processing of personal data in
            individual cases.</p>
          <h2>2. Terms</h2>
          <p>Personal data is all information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. A data
            subject is a person about whom we process personal data.</p>
          <p>Processing includes any handling of personal data, regardless of the means and procedures used, for example
            querying, comparing, adapting, archiving, storing, reading out, disclosing, procuring, collecting,
            collecting, deleting, disclosing, organizing, storing, changing, distributing, linking, destroying and using
            personal data.</p>
          <p>The European Economic Area (EEA) comprises the member States of the European Union (EU) as well as the
            Principality of Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) refers to
            the processing of personal data as the processing of personal data.</p>
          <h2>3. Legal bases</h2>
          <p>We process personal data in accordance with Swiss data protection law, in particular the Federal Act on
            Data Protection (Data Protection Act, DSG) and the Ordinance on Data Protection (Data Protection Ordinance,
            DSV).</p>
          <p>If and to the extent that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applicable, we process personal
            data in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 of the GDPR.</p>
          <h2>4. Nature, scope and purpose</h2>
          <p>We process the personal data that is necessary to be able to carry out our activities and activities
            permanently, user-friendly, secure and reliable. Such personal data can be in particular in the name,
            address, email address, IP address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>
          <p>We process personal data for the period necessary for the respective purpose or purposes or as required by
            law. Personal data whose processing is no longer required will be anonymized or deleted. We don’t have
            personal data processed by third parties.</p>
          <p>In principle, we only process personal data with the consent of the data subjects. If and to the extent
            that processing is permitted for other legal reasons, we may refrain from obtaining consent. For example, we
            may process personal data without consent in order to fulfil a contract, to comply with legal obligations or
            to safeguard overriding interests.</p>
          <p>In this context, we process in particular information that a data subject provides when contacting us – for
            example by letter post, e-mail, instant messaging, contact form, social media or telephone.</p>
          <p>We also process personal data that we receive from third parties, obtain from publicly accessible sources
            or collect in the course of carrying out our activities and activities, if and to the extent that such
            processing is permitted for legal reasons.</p>
          <h2>5. Information sharing and disclosure</h2>
          <p>AnteData does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated
            companies except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under
            the following circumstances:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with AnteData under
              confidentiality agreements. However, these companies do not have any independent right to use or share
              this information.</li>
            <li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or
              defend against legal claims.</li>
            <li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action
              regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical
              safety of any person, violations of AnteData’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
            <li>We transfer information about you if AnteData is acquired by or merged with another company. In this
              event, AnteData will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a
              different privacy policy.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>6. Rights of data subjects</h2>
          <h3>6.1 Data protection claims</h3>
          <p>We grant data subjects all claims in accordance with the applicable data protection law. In particular,
            data subjects have the following rights:</p>
          <p>Information: Data subjects can request information as to whether we are processing personal data about
            them, and if so, which personal data is involved. Data subjects also receive the information that is
            necessary to assert their data protection claims and to ensure transparency. This includes the processed
            personal data as such, but also, among other things, information on the purpose of the processing, the
            duration of storage, any disclosure or export of data to other countries and the origin of the personal
            data.</p>
          <p>Correction and restriction: Data subjects can correct incorrect personal data, complete incomplete data and
            have the processing of their data restricted.</p>
          <p>Deletion and objection: Data subjects can have personal data deleted ("right to be forgotten") and object
            to the processing of their data with effect for the future.</p>
          <p>Data disclosure and data transfer: Data subjects may request the disclosure of personal data or the
            transfer of their data to another person responsible.</p>
          <p>We may postpone, restrict or refuse the exercise of the rights of data subjects to the extent permitted by
            law. We can point out to data subjects any prerequiWebsites to be fulfilled for the exercise of their data
            protection claims. For example, we may refuse to provide information with reference to trade secrets or the
            protection of other persons in whole or in part. For example, we may also refuse the deletion of personal
            data in whole or in part with reference to statutory retention obligations.</p>
          <p>We may exceptionally provide for costs for the exercise of the rights. We inform affected persons in
            advance about any costs.</p>
          <p>We are obliged to take appropriate measures to identify data subjects who request information or assert
            other rights. Data subjects are obliged to cooperate.</p>
          <h3>6.2 Right of appeal</h3>
          <p>Data subjects have the right to enforce their data protection claims by legal means or to lodge a complaint
            with a competent data protection supervisory authority.</p>
          <p>The data protection supervisory authority for private controllers and federal bodies in Switzerland is the
            Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC).</p>
          <p>Data subjects have - if and to the extent that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applicable
            – the right to lodge a complaint with a competent European data protection supervisory authority.</p>
          <h2>7. Data security</h2>
          <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data security appropriate to the
            respective risk. However, we cannot guarantee absolute data security.</p>
          <p>Access to our Website is carried out by means of transport encryption (SSL / TLS, in particular with the
            Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, abbreviated HTTPS). Most browsers mark transport encryption with a
            padlock in the address bar.</p>
          <p>Our digital communication is - as in principle any digital communication - subject to mass surveillance
            without cause and suspicion as well as other surveillance by security authorities in Switzerland, in the
            rest of Europe, in the United States of America (USA) and in other countries. We cannot have any direct
            influence on the corresponding processing of personal data by secret services, police departments and other
            security authorities.</p>
          <h2>8. Services of third parties</h2>
          <p>We use the services of specialized third parties in order to be able to carry out our activities and
            activities permanently, in a user-friendly, safe and reliable manner. Such services allow us, among other
            things, to embed functions and content into our Website. In the case of such an embedding, the services used
            record the IP addresses of the users at least temporarily for technically compelling reasons.</p>
          <p>For necessary security-relevant, statistical and technical purposes, third parties whose services we use
            may process data in connection with our activities and activities in an aggregated, anonymized or
            pseudonymized manner. These are, for example, performance or usage data in order to be able to offer the
            respective service.</p>
          <h3>8.1 Digital infrastructure</h3>
          <p>We use the services of specialized third parties in order to be able to use the necessary digital
            infrastructure in connection with our activities and activities. These include, for example, hosting and
            storage services from selected providers.</p>
          <h3>8.2 Contact options</h3>
          <p>We use services from selected providers in order to be able to communicate better with third parties, such
            as potential and existing customers.</p>
          <h3>8.3 Audio and video conferences</h3>
          <p>We use specialized services for audio and video conferences to be able to communicate online. For example,
            we can use it to hold virtual meetings or conduct online lessons and webinars. The legal texts of the
            individual services, such as data protection declarations and terms of use, also apply to participation in
            audio and video conferences.</p>
          <p>We can adapt and supplement this privacy policy at any time. We will inform about such adjustments and
            additions in an appropriate form, in particular by publishing the current privacy policy on our Website.</p>
